  "title": "Using search_files Module with Drupal 6 on an OSX Server",
  "body": "<p>A current project has had me setting up a large database and community driven site for a client. We're using Drupal 6 because of it's stability, features, extensibility, etc., as well as its great user and community-contributed content. One of the key requirements of this site is the ability to search through large amounts of pre-existing data, most of which are in PDF format. Off to find a proper module for extending Drupal's core search..<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter spending much time researching the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://drupal.org/project/search_files\">search_files module</a>, I eventually threw my hands in the air and switched over to the Google Custom Search Engine. Google CSE allows integrating a search box into your site, and there's of course an existing Drupal module for easy integration into the core search. Google CSE, however, seems to be having major issues with (my luck) file searching! Sure, it's there for some, however after too many days of fiddling with it, forcing re-indexing, allowing for automated re-indexing, tweaking my sitemap.xml, and as many other tricks as I could think of, I was still unable to get Google CSE to take notice of any of my node attachments. It was time to head back to search_files. Here's the key though, for any of you reading this post to actually get this running on an OSX server.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n&bull; <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bluem.net/files/pdftotext.dmg?rev=0\">Grab the copy of pdftotext</a> from <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bluem.net/en/mac/others/\">Carsten Blum's Mac Development page</a><br />\r\n&bull; Install, of course. Checkout the readme. Installs pdftotext (and no other helpers or viewers) to /usr/local/bin/pdftotext<br />\r\n&bull; Install the search_files module (link above) and <b>enable all three modules</b> -- search_files, search_attachments, search_directories<br />\r\n&bull; Head to your search_files settings page, configuring the proper directory for your files (i.e. sites/default/files)<br />\r\n&bull; Change the PDF helper to: <code>/usr/local/bin/pdftotext %file% -</code><br />\r\n&bull; Now go to your standard search settings page, re-index the site, and run Cron a few times. You should be getting attachments in your search results now!</p>"

  "title": "Backing up Dreamweaver to a New Installation (sites and preferences)",
  "body": "<p>After lots of struggling and following notes on other boards, here's a surefire way to get Dreamweaver up and running on a new system with the same preferences and site listings that you've already got (or have on a backup!)</p>\r\n<blockquote><i>Please note that this applies to OSX, not Windows. I had a terrible time trying to get OSX sites onto a Windows machine and have since given up.</i></blockquote>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are 4 components to this backup/import/whatever we want to call it. Note that the directories below refer to CS3 but <i>will be similar</i> to other versions (the ~/ below refers to your home directory, ex: MacHD/Users/username/Library/ is represented below as ~/Library):<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver 9/Configuration</b><br />\r\nIf you simply copy this entire folder into your destination drive, you may notice that it will get renamed to Configuration-1 and a new config will be setup, ignoring your old settings. To counteract this, <b>you need to allow Dreamweaver to create one automatically and then copy and paste ONLY the folders 'SiteCashe' and 'Temp' into 'Configuration'.</b><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/9</b><br />\r\nThis will contain a folder 'Sites' in which rests a 'Site Prefs' file (no extension). <b>Pay close attention here.</b> <i>If your NEW hard drive does not have the same name as your old hard drive, none of the path directives will work</i> (in other words DW will be looking for files on hd 'Macbook' that are actually on 'MacHD' or whatever you've called it). First be sure you've copied all of your old sites to whatever folder they were on your old machine. (I keep everything inside ~/Sites so that it's all accessible to the Apache server.) You will then need to open up 'Site Prefs' inside a plain-text editor. Textedit will do just fine, <b>Dreamweaver WILL NOT</b>. DW will replace the changes you make when you close out, so be sure not to use it to edit this file. Do a find-and-replace from the edit menu and replace any occurrences of your OLD hard drive name with your NEW hard drive name. Now hit save/close and we'll move on to the last 2 copies...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>~/Library/Preferences/Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 Prefs</b><br />\r\ncopy this to your new machine<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>~/Library/Preferences/com.adobe.dreamweaver-9.0.plist</b><br />\r\ncopy this to your new machine<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<i>Update: I forgot to mention keychains. Your keychain (~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain) stores the FTP passwords for all of your sites. I believe that doing a &quot;user settings migration&quot; on a new mac installation will transfer these. If not, you can copy this keychain over by hand to the new directory. Make sure you remember your old login password if you do this...</i><br />\r\n<br />\r\nRun Dreamweaver and you should be gold. Post a comment if you're not.</p>"

  "title": "Problems with Dreamweaver's FTP or SSH Connection?",
  "body": "<p>Adobe Dreamweaver's remote connection setting, whether it's FTP, SSH, SFTP, etc., can be incredibly temperamental. If you're running other apps like messaging or torrents in the background, or basically anything sharing the network connection (this could even be an email attachment download or other passive activity), Dreamweaver can report &quot;Unable to connect&quot;, &quot;Connection refused&quot;, and/or a few other warning when trying to connect with your remote server. While it may be more efficient to be uploading and downloading ftp-style files (large in size, delicate transfer, whatever) without anything else hogging bandwidth, that doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to. I had previously been unable to use Dreamweaver to establish any kind of connection with a remote server while running Adium or bittorrent, or a few other programs that used specific ports (not ftp ports though, so it shouldn't have mattered). Anyways, the following tricks may get you up and running with a server connection that Dreamweaver says isn't responding, when programs like CyberDuck or even built-in ssh / ftp commands are getting through just fine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>1 - Basics</b><br />\r\nUnder 'Manage Sites' - Edit a site and make the 'Remote Info' tab visible.  If using FTP, check Use Passive FTP (or uncheck) and hit Test. Try the same with Use Secure FTP. Try the same with the firewall, and also try turning the firewall on, and  under 'Firewall Settings' disabling 'Disconnect after __ Minutes Idle'. Also, change FTP Time Out to 0 seconds. Firewall port 21 (default ftp port) works fine for me here. You can try IPv6 for the heck of it, but the problem is most likely underlying this... Note, the firewall changes you make apply to Dreamweaver's preferences, not to the site you're currently editing (IOW, settings apply to all sites).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>2 - Router Snags</b><br />\r\nRun a traceroute through your shell (terminal, type <code>traceroute the.ip.address.or.server.name</code> Any large delays? While the firewall setting should have stopped this, you may still be seeing a hiccup which DW is getting timed out at. </p>\r\n<blockquote><i>(This is not a likely solution either, but at this point you can close DW, trash your preferences (~/Library/Preferences/Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 Prefs), and reopen. Change the firewall settings to 0 second timeout, or disable the firewall, and try to connect. If it works, hurrah, you're done.)</i></blockquote>\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf the delay is between you and the gateway or the gateway and your ISP (or whatever the next step may be in your case), this may be easily curable. Try swapping out the router for an alternate, if you have it, and test DW's connection. If it's working, you will need to take a look at your router's settings. You can go crazy and check what packets are actually being sent through what ports by DW, or you can compare the routers firewall settings or any kind of port forwarding / triggering, blocking it may be doing and make changes accordingly. I have had many occurrences of this problem behind 2Wire and dlink routers with Dreamweaver, but nearly none behind my linksy router. My work Linksys, I should note, is running <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.polarcloud.com/tofu\">HyperWRT + Tofu</a> (Tofu required for StarCraft :) but I've had good luck with any linksys.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>3 -</b> Try wired vs wireless network connections (if you haven't already). Wireless are prone to packet loss. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>4 -</b> Are you on Windows? Temporarily disable any firewalls, ip filters, etc., that may be interferring (if you haven't already). You should know that any type of mainstream anti-virus like Norton, Symantec, Mcafee, etc., will most likely block DW. Download AVG or something like that instead and save the money.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>5 -</b> Connected to an Apple base station? <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?messageID=5628420\">Enable FTP Access</a> through the Airport control panel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nStill no luck?

A lot of you that stumble upon this post just need to enable (or force) php5 instead of php4, as your hosting provider is probably supporting both and enabling 4 over 5 by default. This is assuming that you&#39;re on a clean install of Drupal, no crazy htaccess rules, and error 500 seems to have come &quot;out of nowhere&quot;. Additional problems with 500 usually come from htaccess but can also exist because of other improper server settings -- php.ini, htpasswd files that are wrecked, etc. I think that 99% of the time, with Drupal at least, you&#39;ll be able to fix them by process of elimination inside your htaccess.<br />\r\n   <br />\r\n  Another possible fix is to comment out *all* rewrite rules temporarily and see if the home page or admin page loads (?q= or ?q=admin)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <strong>Update 4/6/2010<br />\r\n   </strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    This page gets a lot of traffic so I&#39;ve disabled auth required for comments and allowed all anonymous users to post.

Now that I'm on 2 Windows 7 systems I&nbsp;thought I'd try <a href=\"http://sync.live.com\">Windows Live Sync</a>, which honestly worked damn well for several weeks in auto-synchronizing multiple folders. There is a 20,000 file limit per folder, which you can get around by syncing a couple sub-folders, and it uses P2P to transmit/receive files (which means than on a LAN&nbsp;you can get incredibly fast syncs). There is, however, one huge rediculous drawback to using Live Sync: everytime the <a href=\"http://windowslivesync.spaces.live.com/\">Microsoft Sync Development Team</a> decides to release a new version of the client, you are forced to start from scratch. Completely. All of your relationships are gone, and after setting them back up you will find that there are now multiple copies of all of the files you have modified. For example, in a synced folder, you will have 2 files &quot;photo.jpg&quot; and&nbsp;&quot;photo.jpg@COMPUTER-NAME&quot;. If you're like me and modify hundreds of filed in multiple folders from week to week, you are left with all these extra useless files and forced to reconnect all folder relationships. Microsoft was nice enough to give their development team a blog on Live Spaces, but I'm not sure why considering the authors of the blog posts never respond to the waves of comments flooding their system with this problem.

It gives great insight into your content popularity, visitor characteristics, and more, and has some very cool (and easy to setup) reporting abilities. Being a fan of the open-source world and a generally &quot;stay away from the man&quot; minded user, I'm always trying out low-cost / no-cost alternatives to the big guns. In this case Google Analytics is free, but.. still. They are a giant.</p>\r\n<p>Anyways, I&nbsp;think Piwik is a great alternative and has a fantastic, intuitive and very clever user interface. It does great tracking, has a ton of features that you'd find in something like Google Analytics, and it's also free. What are the downsides? Well, it's understandably in Beta still, but I've had Piwik installations that worked great for months and then stopped due to a MySQL insert hiccup. I've also had PHP&nbsp;warning errors come and go. These things are fixed in subsequent releases, but I&nbsp;can't stall a client's website tracking due to unfinished software. Sure, it's a bad idea to use beta software on a client's site in the first place, but regardless of the application usage, I&nbsp;think there's a more fundamental concept to think about.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Google Analytics stores information *off* your server, Piwik stores it on your server.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Sure, you could use an alternate server to run Piwik. Maybe that's even a recommended method. But the scripts that execute on page loads which store visitor information would be something you control, in your own domain (so to speak), and I've been leaning towards the &quot;track your visitors from outside your realm&quot;... realm. <strong>Store the information outside your servers. </strong></p>\r\n<p>Use a different, consistent, high-uptime server (like Google Analytics) that has its own team of developers that keep things running. If for some reason your own self-proprietary tracking system goes down you won't know until you've already lost real-time tracking data. It's the same methodology of using a website uptime service (like <a href=\"http://host-tracker.com/order-page/\">host-tracker</a>). You shouldn't run scheduled tasks (or whatever method) from other webservers or your own PC to test your site's uptime; that opens the door to error. Use a service that helps you avoid the single point of failure. Just my two cents. </p>"

  "title": "Gathering Statistics on Blocked Images in Email Marketing Campaigns",
  "body": "<p>A lot of my clients use different email system to handle their marketing campaigns. Whether it&#39;s RatePoint, Constant Contact, or some of their own proprietary platforms, they are all running into the same problem -- most modern email systems don&#39;t display inline images by default. This gives them the fear that their mailings are giving an even lower return rate to an already low rate. I tend to think that the people who pay attention to email-based advertisements are pretty likely to hit the &quot;always display images from this sender&quot; button, but you can never be sure. Additionally, people tend to differ in these regards from product to product.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Anyways, I&#39;m going to be inserting some of my own tracking into clients email campaigns to see who&#39;s really displaying the images. Simply place &lt;img src=&quot;http://myserver.com/img.php&quot; /&gt; line in the source of your mailer, and have the corresponding php file contain this sample&nbsp;code:</p>\r\n<pre>\r\n<?php\r\n// declare content-type so browser knows to expect and image\r\nheader(\"Content-type: image/jpeg\");\r\n\r\n// print the file to screen\r\necho readfile('img.jpg');\r\n\r\n// create an integer and assign it the value of the contents of a text file\r\n$i = file_get_contents('stats.txt');\r\n// if textfile has no value (or doesn't exist yet) just say '0'\r\nif(strlen($i) == 0) $i=0;\r\n// since the image is being called and loaded, add 1 to our counter\r\n$i++;\r\n\r\n// write these changes to our stat counter file\r\n$fp = fopen('stats.txt', \"w\");\r\nfwrite($fp, $i);\r\nfclose($fp);\r\n?>\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>\r\nThe img.jpg could be a 1 pixel square or a real image from your html email, it's up to you. To track, this script simply takes the value of the current # of reads (stored in stats.txt) and adds 1 to it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>I'm curious to see how Gmail or Outlook handles this. Emails that come through Gmail and have inline images display in a box that's the same width and height of the image (until the image loads). So I'm curious if they're doing any pre-loading (which would trigger this script) or if they are doing pre-loading once per request (regardless of how many emails use the same file) and caching the data.</p>"

  "title": "Anatomy of a Drupal Theme - The Node Object",
  "body": "<p>\r\n  The function behind the $node object is <a href=\"http://api.drupal.org/api/function/node_load/6\">node_load()</a>. This brings the $node object into play within your node.tpl.php template file and gives you the ability to <em>display </em>any variables from the node.&nbsp;Drupal handles everything behind the scenes -- access permissions, attached taxonomy, attached files, meta information, and more -- and hands you the gift wrapped object. In addition to the core variables, <strong>the node object also includes any added variables, such as CCK fields.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    In other words, <em>you can theme a completely custom page to match whatever you dreamed up in Photoshop simply by printing the needed $node values into the appropriate places.</em> This is probably obvious to many, but the elegance can get lost on the new user. For example, take this documentation page from Drupal.org:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <a href=\"/files/theme-01.jpg\" class=\"fancy-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/theme-01.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 325px; \" /></a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n   For the sake of this article, let&#39;s assume there are a few standard node fields and a few additional CCK fields within this page:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n    <a href=\"/files/theme-02.jpg\" class=\"fancy-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/files/theme-02.jpg\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 361px; \" /></a></p>\r\n<p>\r\n   While the sidebars and overall layout are defined in our page.tpl.php, the node.tpl.php file could be as simple as this:</p>\r\n<pre style=\"color:#d1d1d1;background:#000000;\">\r\n<span style=\"color:#ff8906;

  "title": "Anatomy of a Drupal Theme - Basic Structure",
  "body": "<p>\r\n  It can be a bit confusing to create a custom theme for Drupal. Users new to this process typically hack a core theme like Garland, or grab a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://drupal.org/project/themes?solrsort=sis_project_release_usage%20desc&amp;text=starting\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(73, 190, 223); \">starting theme</a>&nbsp;from the repository, but then it&#39;s easy to get frustrated with all the different template files, functions, and styles. After all, what are these extra functions? Why aren&#39;t they included in Drupal&#39;s core if they&#39;re so necessary? Why do I see page.tpl.php and a bunch of node-*.tpl.php files and a dozen other .php and misc files? I&#39;ll try to cover some of the basic concepts of Drupal theming and get into the more advanced stuff in later posts. My goal here is to really break things down on a simple, linear level.</p>\r\n<!--break-->\r\n<h2>\r\n Describe Your Theme to Drupal</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n   Every theme will need a <strong>theme-name.info</strong> file to describe the theme -- the name, the version, and the version of Drupal on which it can run, the locations of the JavaScript and CSS files, and to define the names of regions that blocks can be placed into.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n    Add Functions and Theme Settings</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n    You can define functions within the <strong>template.php</strong> file to be used throughout your theme. Perhaps you want to list taxonomy terms or re-build the user login form based upon your own needs -- these custom functions can be setup within template.php.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n You can also define settings that pertain to your theme within <strong>theme-settings.php</strong>. These configuration options will appear at <em>~/admin/build/themes/settings/your-theme-name</em>. Theme settings might include tab styles, enabling or disabling certain block regions, or specifying where regions should go within your layout. I&#39;ve found that theme-settings.php typically only pertains to <em>community themes</em> as a <em>custom theme</em>&nbsp;has all of its layout predefined in the template and CSS files.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n    Page.tpl.php</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n    Your primary page template defines the overall structure of the page -- for example, the doctype declaration, html, head, and body tags, perhaps some general formatting like your div elements, and the closing body and html tags. You can also set block regions within this file. <strong>Think of page.tpl.php as your main &quot;index.html&quot; file that allows you to suggest and stylize the main structure of your site.</strong></p>\r\n<p>\r\n    Check out the <a href=\"http://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules--system--page.tpl.php\">page.tpl.php API page</a> for a list of available variables.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>Node.tpl.php</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n The node.tpl.php template file handles the structure and styles of the&nbsp;<em>node content only</em>. Do I have to have a node.tpl.php? No, but you&#39;d be missing out on all the flexibility and power that Drupal brings in the first place. If you simply print out $content in your page.tpl.php template, Drupal will spit out the page in a pre-formatted way. The beauty of the node.tpl.php template is that it allows you to specify the exact layout of the body of any Drupal node.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n Check out the&nbsp;<a href=\"\" style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(73, 190, 223); \">node.tpl.php API page</a>&nbsp;for a list of available variables.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>\r\n  A Simple Theme</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n  The most basic Drupal theme really could consist of this:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n   <p>\r\n     customtheme/<br />\r\n      &nbsp;&nbsp; customtheme.info<br />\r\n     &nbsp;&nbsp; page.tpl.php</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n   customtheme.info source:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       name = CustomTheme</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       description = A really simple custom Drupal theme.</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       core = 6.x</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       engine = phptemplate</div>\r\n  <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       regions[sidebar] = Sidebar</div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n    <br />\r\n  page.tpl.php source:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &lt;html&gt;</div>\r\n  <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &lt;head&gt;</div>\r\n  <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;title&gt;&lt;?php print $head_title; ?&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</div>\r\n  <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;?php print $head; ?&gt;</div>\r\n   <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;?php print $styles; ?&gt;</div>\r\n <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &lt;/head&gt;</div>\r\n <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &nbsp;</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &lt;body&gt;</div>\r\n  <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &nbsp;</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &lt;?php print $logo; ?&gt;</div>\r\n   <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &lt;?php print $primary_link; ?&gt;</div>\r\n   <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &lt;?php print $title; ?&gt;</div>\r\n  <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &lt;?php print $tabs; ?&gt;</div>\r\n   <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &lt;?php print $content; ?&gt;</div>\r\n    <div>\r\n       &nbsp;</div>\r\n    <div>\r\n       &lt;div id=&quot;sidebar&quot;&gt;</div>\r\n    <div>\r\n       &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;?php print $sidebar; ?&gt;</div>\r\n    <div>\r\n       &lt;/div&gt;</div>\r\n  <div>\r\n       &nbsp;</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &lt;?php print $closure; ?&gt;</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &nbsp;</div>\r\n    <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &lt;/body&gt;</div>\r\n <div id=\"cke_pastebin\">\r\n       &lt;/html&gt;</div>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n <br />\r\n  This would give you a theme called &quot;CustomTheme&quot; on the ~/admin/build/theme page which outputs your dynamic primary navigation, any node content, your sidebar region and any blocks within it, and includes the proper META tags, etc., for your pages.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n   While overly simple, the structure of a theme should now be apparent to the new Drupal themer. Once you&#39;re comfortable with this setup, you&#39;ll certainly want to add the design and usability that your website requires; throughout that process you&#39;ll inherently need to add the additional theme files that will make it possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n This brings us to the next stage of a custom theme - <a href=\"/content/anatomy-drupal-theme-node-object\">the node object</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

  "title": "Make a Drupal image gallery without using modules",
  "body": "<p>I can't stand the over-use of contrib modules when they just aren't necessary. When a visitor loads your Drupal front page, all of your modules are opened and read by the server whether they affect the front page or not. PHP searches files for hooks that need to be fired, a huge number of database requests are made that don't necessarily have a purpose, and on the list goes. Why use modules that perform tasks <em>already available to you</em> such as including a JS library in your theme's folder, firing a trigger/action when a user logs in, or building your own custom content type? Speaking of the latter, I've been giving customers really simple image galleries through the use of CCK/ImageCache for Drupal 6 OR Fields/Image Styles for Drupal 7 and not relying on something like the Image module that requires the customer to understand taxonomy, how to track down image nodes and how they are related to the \"master\" image gallery term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Regardless of whether you're doing this in D6 or D7, the overall process is the same:</strong><p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Create a new content type called \"Photo Gallery\" or whatever makes the most sense for your project.</li>\r\n<li>Add the necessary fields (for D6 you'll want to have CCK and ImageField installed; most sites will already have those):\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Title</li>\r\n<li>Body (keep it or lose it -- make this image gallery your own!)</li>\r\n<li>Images - create an new field called \"Images\" or \"Photos\", type = File, Widget = Image (D6) or Type = Image (D7):<br />\r\n<a href=\"/files/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%205.30.03%20PM.png\" class=\"fancy-image\"><img src=\"/files/styles/large/public/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%205.30.03%20PM.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: auto;\" /></a></li>\r\n<li>Make sure you set Images to be an \"unlimited\" field:<br /><img src=\"/files/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%205.29.42%20PM.png\" /></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Head to the \"Display\" tab for this content type, and configure the Images field to be displayed however you'd like. I recommend setting the image to display as a ImageCache/Image Style preset that links to another ImageCache/Image Style preset, then use something like <a href=\"http://fancybox.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Fancybox</a> to hijack the links to display in an overlay.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<h2>Here's what you'll get:</h2>\r\n<a href=\"/files/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%205.57.47%20PM.png\" class=\"fancy-image\"><img src=\"/files/styles/large/public/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%205.57.47%20PM.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: auto;\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"/files/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%206.02.00%20PM.png\" class=\"fancy-image\"><img src=\"/files/styles/large/public/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%206.02.00%20PM.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: auto;\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"/files/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%206.02.21%20PM.png\" class=\"fancy-image\"><img src=\"/files/styles/large/public/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%206.02.21%20PM.png\" style=\"width: 400px; height: auto;\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Use this mindset throughout Drupal.</strong> Don't get trigger happy installing dozens of modules that do this for you -- setup the structure yourself and you'll have a more custom site that you know and control, and can better meet your clients needs and give them something that's less confusing to maintain.</p>"

All of the Webform B submissions are tied to the original Webform A's submission, and show up when viewing that original submission.\r\n\r\nThis is useful for sporting event signups where players must all fill out their own info and agree to a liability waiver (Webform B) once the coach or manager has registered the team (Webform A).
