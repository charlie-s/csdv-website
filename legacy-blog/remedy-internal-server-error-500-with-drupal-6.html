Save, upload, and refresh your page.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, forcing php5 instead of version 4 may help this. You can do so by adding</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AddType x-mapp-php5 .php<br>AddHandler x-mapp-php5 .php</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>to your .htaccess file.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Update - 1/17/2010</b></p><p>There are, of course, lots of causes for a 500 error. It was a little lame of me to suggest that disabling symlinks would fix them all. A lot of you that stumble upon this post just need to enable (or force) php5 instead of php4, as your hosting provider is probably supporting both and enabling 4 over 5 by default. This is assuming that you&#39;re on a clean install of Drupal, no crazy htaccess rules, and error 500 seems to have come &quot;out of nowhere&quot;. Additional problems with 500 usually come from htaccess but can also exist because of other improper server settings -- php.ini, htpasswd files that are wrecked, etc. I think that 99% of the time, with Drupal at least, you&#39;ll be able to fix them by process of elimination inside your htaccess.<br><br>Another possible fix is to comment out *all* rewrite rules temporarily and see if the home page or admin page loads (?q= or ?q=admin)</p><p><strong>Update 4/6/2010<br></strong></p><p>This page gets a lot of traffic so I&#39;ve disabled auth required for comments and allowed all anonymous users to post. Please comment with your own solution if you were able to find one and I will incorporate into this post.</p></div><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fastclick/1.0.6/fastclick.min.js"></script><script>if ('addEventListener' in document) {
