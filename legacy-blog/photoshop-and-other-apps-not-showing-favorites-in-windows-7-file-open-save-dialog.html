I'm not sure on why it's showing the older dialog, as other applications that aren't aware they're running in Windows 7 seem to show the new dialog. Anyways, the big problem here is that your places, shortcuts, favorites, bookmarks, whatever the hell you want to call them, aren't visible.</p><p>If you, like me, have setup some serious favorites in your &quot;places&quot; column (left side) of the explorer window, you will definitely come to rely on them for your workflow. In order to get these to display quickly in non-native file browsers, you will need to change some Group Policy permissions (gpedit.msc). If you've got Windows 7 Home premium (or lower)&nbsp;you won't be able to run gpedit.msc... unfortunately it's one of the features in business and ultimate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fastclick/1.0.6/fastclick.min.js"></script><script>if ('addEventListener' in document) {
