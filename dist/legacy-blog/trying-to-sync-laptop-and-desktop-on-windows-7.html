That worked prety darn well, except the&nbsp;transfer speeds seemed to go up and down. (MobileMe is horrendously slow and not worth using for more than documents and photos.) Now that I'm on 2 Windows 7 systems I&nbsp;thought I'd try <a href="http://sync.live.com">Windows Live Sync</a>, which honestly worked damn well for several weeks in auto-synchronizing multiple folders. There is a 20,000 file limit per folder, which you can get around by syncing a couple sub-folders, and it uses P2P to transmit/receive files (which means than on a LAN&nbsp;you can get incredibly fast syncs). There is, however, one huge rediculous drawback to using Live Sync: everytime the <a href="http://windowslivesync.spaces.live.com/">Microsoft Sync Development Team</a> decides to release a new version of the client, you are forced to start from scratch. Completely. All of your relationships are gone, and after setting them back up you will find that there are now multiple copies of all of the files you have modified. For example, in a synced folder, you will have 2 files &quot;photo.jpg&quot; and&nbsp;&quot;photo.jpg@COMPUTER-NAME&quot;. If you're like me and modify hundreds of filed in multiple folders from week to week, you are left with all these extra useless files and forced to reconnect all folder relationships. Microsoft was nice enough to give their development team a blog on Live Spaces, but I'm not sure why considering the authors of the blog posts never respond to the waves of comments flooding their system with this problem. It's happened three times now and I've had to give up trying to use their service; the convenience isn't worth all of the headaches.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fastclick/1.0.6/fastclick.min.js"></script><script>if ('addEventListener' in document) {
