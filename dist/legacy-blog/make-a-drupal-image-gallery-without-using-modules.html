When a visitor loads your Drupal front page, all of your modules are opened and read by the server whether they affect the front page or not. PHP searches files for hooks that need to be fired, a huge number of database requests are made that don't necessarily have a purpose, and on the list goes. Why use modules that perform tasks <em>already available to you</em> such as including a JS library in your theme's folder, firing a trigger/action when a user logs in, or building your own custom content type? Speaking of the latter, I've been giving customers really simple image galleries through the use of CCK/ImageCache for Drupal 6 OR Fields/Image Styles for Drupal 7 and not relying on something like the Image module that requires the customer to understand taxonomy, how to track down image nodes and how they are related to the "master" image gallery term.</p><p><strong>Regardless of whether you're doing this in D6 or D7, the overall process is the same:</strong></p><p><ol><li>Create a new content type called "Photo Gallery" or whatever makes the most sense for your project.</li><li>Add the necessary fields (for D6 you'll want to have CCK and ImageField installed; most sites will already have those):<ul><li>Title</li><li>Body (keep it or lose it -- make this image gallery your own!)</li><li>Images - create an new field called "Images" or "Photos", type = File, Widget = Image (D6) or Type = Image (D7):<br><a href="/files/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%205.30.03%20PM.png" class="fancy-image"><img src="/files/styles/large/public/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%205.30.03%20PM.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto"></a></li><li>Make sure you set Images to be an "unlimited" field:<br><img src="/files/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%205.29.42%20PM.png"></li></ul></li><li>Head to the "Display" tab for this content type, and configure the Images field to be displayed however you'd like. I recommend setting the image to display as a ImageCache/Image Style preset that links to another ImageCache/Image Style preset, then use something like <a href="http://fancybox.net/" target="_blank">Fancybox</a> to hijack the links to display in an overlay.</li></ol><h2>Here's what you'll get:</h2><a href="/files/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%205.57.47%20PM.png" class="fancy-image"><img src="/files/styles/large/public/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%205.57.47%20PM.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto"></a> <a href="/files/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%206.02.00%20PM.png" class="fancy-image"><img src="/files/styles/large/public/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%206.02.00%20PM.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto"></a> <a href="/files/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%206.02.21%20PM.png" class="fancy-image"><img src="/files/styles/large/public/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-04%20at%206.02.21%20PM.png" style="width: 400px; height: auto"></a></p><p><strong>Use this mindset throughout Drupal.</strong> Don't get trigger happy installing dozens of modules that do this for you -- setup the structure yourself and you'll have a more custom site that you know and control, and can better meet your clients needs and give them something that's less confusing to maintain.</p></div><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fastclick/1.0.6/fastclick.min.js"></script><script>if ('addEventListener' in document) {
