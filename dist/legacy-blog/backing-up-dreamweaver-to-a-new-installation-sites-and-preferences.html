I had a terrible time trying to get OSX sites onto a Windows machine and have since given up.</i></blockquote><p><br><br>There are 4 components to this backup/import/whatever we want to call it. Note that the directories below refer to CS3 but <i>will be similar</i> to other versions (the ~/ below refers to your home directory, ex: MacHD/Users/username/Library/ is represented below as ~/Library):<br><br><b>~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver 9/Configuration</b><br>If you simply copy this entire folder into your destination drive, you may notice that it will get renamed to Configuration-1 and a new config will be setup, ignoring your old settings. To counteract this, <b>you need to allow Dreamweaver to create one automatically and then copy and paste ONLY the folders 'SiteCashe' and 'Temp' into 'Configuration'.</b><br><br><b>~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/9</b><br>This will contain a folder 'Sites' in which rests a 'Site Prefs' file (no extension). <b>Pay close attention here.</b> <i>If your NEW hard drive does not have the same name as your old hard drive, none of the path directives will work</i> (in other words DW will be looking for files on hd 'Macbook' that are actually on 'MacHD' or whatever you've called it). First be sure you've copied all of your old sites to whatever folder they were on your old machine. (I keep everything inside ~/Sites so that it's all accessible to the Apache server.) You will then need to open up 'Site Prefs' inside a plain-text editor. Textedit will do just fine, <b>Dreamweaver WILL NOT</b>. DW will replace the changes you make when you close out, so be sure not to use it to edit this file. Do a find-and-replace from the edit menu and replace any occurrences of your OLD hard drive name with your NEW hard drive name. Now hit save/close and we'll move on to the last 2 copies...<br><br><b>~/Library/Preferences/Adobe Dreamweaver CS3 Prefs</b><br>copy this to your new machine<br><br><b>~/Library/Preferences/com.adobe.dreamweaver-9.0.plist</b><br>copy this to your new machine<br><br><i>Update: I forgot to mention keychains. Your keychain (~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain) stores the FTP passwords for all of your sites. I believe that doing a &quot;user settings migration&quot; on a new mac installation will transfer these. If not, you can copy this keychain over by hand to the new directory. Make sure you remember your old login password if you do this...</i><br><br>Run Dreamweaver and you should be gold.
