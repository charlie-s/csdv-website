We needed to use the Pro Extended to get some of the features that weren't there in lesser versions (<i>Pro</i> and <i>Standard</i>). After doing a bit of searching, however, I wasn't able to pull up a list that quickly compared the different feature sets. Below is a quick rundown should anyone need it...<br><br><b>Acrobat 9 Pro Extended vs Pro</b><br>- Extended Version includes Adobe Presenter and Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES (beyond the scope of this article or my needs...)<br>- Convert to Flash Video only in Extended<br>- search and measurement tools for &ldquo;geospatially-enabled PDF maps&rdquo; only in Extended<br>- Convert CAD and 3D content to PDFs, again, only in Extended -- this is consistent with Photoshop CS3's (extended? basic? both?) ability to work with 3d and CAD files.<br><br><b>Acrobat 9 Standard</b><br>- Lacks PDF validation, redaction, and digital signatures.<br>- Basic stuff like form entry, plugins for Microsoft Office apps, security enabling, etc.<br><br>That brings me to the question -- <b>Why pay US$299 for Acrobat 9 Standard when you can get ver 8 for cheaper?</b><br><br><b>General New Features in Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro</b><br>- Enable real-time collaboration of PDFs with synchronized document views and chat<br>- Improved Web Capture for capturing entire web pages or just some parts into PDF<br>- Integration with acrobat.com to enable storage and sharing of PDF files <i>(this is kind of a big deal, as it will make the collaboration process simplier, more efficient, and easier for groups that work on projects from remote locations)</i><br>- Personalize a PDF Portfolio with customizable templates for navigation and branding <i>(this will help with uniform PDF branding)</i><br>- Compare and highlight the differences between two versions of a PDF document<br>- Insert FLV (Flash) or H.264 video for direct playback in Adobe Acrobat&reg; and Adobe Reader<br>- Convert a variety of video formats to FLV for playback in PDF<br>- Create PDF maps by importing geospatial files that retain metadata and coordinates <i>(as a vector graphics guy who understand the viability of vector-data comprared to pixel-data, this is exciting)</i><br><br>Users looking to grab a free trial from Adobe.com - go here. Although there is no trial for OSX users, and from what I'm reading the only version available for OSX may be Pro (no standard, no extended).</p></div><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fastclick/1.0.6/fastclick.min.js"></script><script>if ('addEventListener' in document) {
