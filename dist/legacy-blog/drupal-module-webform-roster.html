Basically, you can assign Webform B to be the roster form for Webform A. When a user completes Webform A they're sent a link to complete Webform B. This link can be used an infinite number of times, so the original user could fill out Webform B immediately, or send the link to a dozen others (which is what my needs are). All of the Webform B submissions are tied to the original Webform A's submission, and show up when viewing that original submission. This is useful for sporting event signups where players must all fill out their own info and agree to a liability waiver (Webform B) once the coach or manager has registered the team (Webform A). I can see a lot of other useful scenarios where registration forms could have a "part 2". I'd like to ultimately extend this a bit further to give you a qualifier for sending the link, but this is currently pretty small and working quite well. The module is available at http://drupal.org/project/webform_roster</div><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fastclick/1.0.6/fastclick.min.js"></script><script>if ('addEventListener' in document) {
