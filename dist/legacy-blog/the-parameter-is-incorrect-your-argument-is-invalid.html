I&nbsp;was migrating some files across the network from his old laptop to his new laptop and bam -- suddenly explorer windows disappeared, all icons on the dock turned into white, and trying to run any program (including cmd, notepad, regedit, regsvr32, control panel, etc.) or open a new explorer windows gave me errors like this:</p><p class="rteindent1"><em>No such interface supported.<br></em></p><p class="rteindent1"><em>The parameter is incorrect.<br></em></p><p class="rteindent1"><em>Explorer.EXE&nbsp;Unspecified error</em></p><p class="rteindent1"><em>This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action.</em></p><p>Anyways, after trying the solutions offered through searching Google, such as re-registering .dll&#39;s, addind a new user from the command line (which is really easy!&nbsp;boot in safe mode with command prompt and type &quot;net user username password /add&quot;), and other methods that have apparently worked for others, the only solution I could find was to reboot, hold f8, choose system recover, and do a System Restore to a couple days ago.</p><p>Bummer.</p></div><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fastclick/1.0.6/fastclick.min.js"></script><script>if ('addEventListener' in document) {
