Whether it&#39;s RatePoint, Constant Contact, or some of their own proprietary platforms, they are all running into the same problem -- most modern email systems don&#39;t display inline images by default. This gives them the fear that their mailings are giving an even lower return rate to an already low rate. I tend to think that the people who pay attention to email-based advertisements are pretty likely to hit the &quot;always display images from this sender&quot; button, but you can never be sure. Additionally, people tend to differ in these regards from product to product.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyways, I&#39;m going to be inserting some of my own tracking into clients email campaigns to see who&#39;s really displaying the images. Simply place &lt;img src=&quot;http://myserver.com/img.php&quot; /&gt; line in the source of your mailer, and have the corresponding php file contain this sample&nbsp;code:</p><pre>
<?php
// declare content-type so browser knows to expect and image
header("Content-type: image/jpeg");

// print the file to screen
echo readfile('img.jpg');

// create an integer and assign it the value of the contents of a text file
$i = file_get_contents('stats.txt');
// if textfile has no value (or doesn't exist yet) just say '0'
if(strlen($i) == 0) $i=0;
// since the image is being called and loaded, add 1 to our counter
$i++;

// write these changes to our stat counter file
$fp = fopen('stats.txt', "w");
fwrite($fp, $i);
fclose($fp);
?>
</pre><p>The img.jpg could be a 1 pixel square or a real image from your html email, it's up to you. To track, this script simply takes the value of the current # of reads (stored in stats.txt) and adds 1 to it.</p><p>I'm curious to see how Gmail or Outlook handles this. Emails that come through Gmail and have inline images display in a box that's the same width and height of the image (until the image loads). So I'm curious if they're doing any pre-loading (which would trigger this script) or if they are doing pre-loading once per request (regardless of how many emails use the same file) and caching the data.</p></div><script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fastclick/1.0.6/fastclick.min.js"></script><script>if ('addEventListener' in document) {
